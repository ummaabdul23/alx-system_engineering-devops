### Postmortem: The Great Connection Pool Tsunami üåä

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 2 hours (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM WAT, August 15, 2024)
- **Impact:** The WorkSmart homework submission portal turned into WorkSloooow, with 60% of users wondering if they‚Äôd accidentally traveled back to the dial-up era. Submissions were delayed, and some users couldn‚Äôt even load the site. Teachers and students alike were left in suspense, not knowing whether their homework had been submitted or vanished into the ether.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured connection pool led to a tidal wave of database connections, causing the server to wave a white flag in surrender. üè≥Ô∏è

**Timeline:**

- **10:05 AM:** Monitoring alert went off like a fire alarm, signaling response times slower than a sloth on a Sunday.
- **10:10 AM:** The engineering team huddled together, initially blaming the network for slacking off.
- **10:20 AM:** After the network was found to be behaving (for once), the team scratched their heads.
- **10:30 AM:** A customer reached out with, ‚ÄúIs the site down or is it just me?‚Äù Nope, not just you.
- **10:45 AM:** The team noticed database connection errors piling up like laundry on a teenager‚Äôs floor.
- **11:00 AM:** Database admins were called in, like the cavalry in a Western movie.
- **11:15 AM:** The admins quickly spotted the culprit: a connection pool party that got way out of hand.
- **11:30 AM:** Pool capacity was reined in, and the database server could finally catch its breath.
- **11:45 AM:** The portal started to come back to life‚Äîusers could now submit homework without contemplating their life choices.
- **12:00 PM:** The system was fully back on track, and the engineers took a collective sigh of relief.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** The application‚Äôs connection pool was configured with the enthusiasm of an overzealous party planner who invites everyone they‚Äôve ever met. As more users accessed the platform, the connection pool grew like a balloon ready to pop, overwhelming the database server. The server, not built for this kind of popularity, began to struggle, leading to the slow performance and outages.

- **Resolution:** The fix was simple but effective: set some ground rules for the connection pool. By limiting the number of active connections per application instance, we made sure the server wouldn‚Äôt drown in connections the next time there was a surge. The server was also restarted, giving it a well-deserved break from the chaos.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements:**
  - Review all configurations with the same attention to detail as a detective in a mystery novel.
  - Add monitoring for database connections so we can spot a potential flood before it happens.
  - Conduct regular stress tests to ensure the system can handle even the rowdiest of connection pool parties.

- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Patch the database driver to prevent it from inviting too many connections to the pool.
  - [ ] Set up alerts for when the number of active connections approaches a dangerous level.
  - [ ] Run load tests periodically, because knowing is half the battle.
  - [ ] Update our incident response checklist to include, ‚ÄúDid we check the connection pool?‚Äù

**Conclusion:**  
While the outage was inconvenient, it gave us a chance to strengthen our systems and avoid similar hiccups in the future. Besides, it‚Äôs not every day you get to host a connection pool party, right? üéâ
